# Large Language Models Interview Questions
This repository contains interview questions about Large Language Models (LLMs). 

I am using this reference: [Mastering LLM](https://www.masteringllm.com/course/llm-interview-questions-and-answers) as the base, credit to them for compiling it, however, I am taking _alot_ of liberies with editing the questions, as well as the answers, they are completely my own.

_Note:_ I am trying to keep the answers I write myself to a minumum, since I am in no way or form an authoritative source on this topic. I will be providing references to the best of my ability.

I also plan to expand this to Generative AI in general.

## What is the difference between Predictive/Discriminative and Generative AI Models?
Let's consider a dataset, where each data point represents a cat. Let's pass it through to each type of model, and see how they differ:
- **Predictive/Discriminative Model**: This type of model will either try to discriminate between different data points, by virtue of a decision boundary, and a mapping function, or by predicting the probability of a class label given the model's ability to learn patterns from the data.
- **Generative Model**: This type of model will try to generate new data points, by learning the underlying distribution of the data given all the data points in the dataset.

## What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
Let's build the definition of a Large Language Model (LLM) from the ground up:
- **Language Models (LMs)**: These are probabilistic models that learn from natural language, they can range from simple bayesian models to more complex neural networks.
- **Large**: Consider all the data available, a literal dump of the internet, enough compute to process and learn from it, and a model that can handle the complexity of the data.
- **Large Language Model**: The amalgamation of the two, a model that can learn from a large amount of data, and generate text that is coherent and human-like.

## How are Large Language Models trained?
Large Language Models are often trained in multiple stages, these stages are often named pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment. 
### Pretraining: 
The purpose of this stage is to expose the model to _all of language_, in an unsupervised manner, it is often the most expensive part of training, and requires a lot of compute. Pretraining is often done on something like the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) dataset, processed versions of the dataset such as [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) and [RedPajama](https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data) are often used for pretraining.
To facilitate this broad type of learning, there exists multiple training tasks we can use, such as Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), and more.

Mask Language Modeling is based of the [Cloze Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test), where we mask out a word in a sentence, and ask the model to predict it. Similar to a fill in the blank test. It differs from asking the model to predict the next word in a sentence, as it requires the model to understand the context of the sentence, and not just the sequence of words.

Next Sentence Prediction is a task where the model is given two sentences, and it has to predict if the second sentence follows the first one. As simple as it sounds, it requires the model to understand the context of the first sentence, and the relationship between the two sentences.

An excellent resource to learn more about these tasks is the [BERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

### Fine-tuning:
This stage is much simpler than pretraining, as the model has already learned a lot about language, and now we just need to teach it about a specific task. All we need for this stage is the input data (prompts) and the labels (responses). 

### Alignment:
This stage is often the most cruical and complex stage, it requires the use of seperate reward models, the use of different learning paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning, and more. 

This stage mainly aims to align the model's predictions with the human's preferences. This stage often interweaves with the fine-tuning stage. Essential reading for this stage is the [InstructGPT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155), this paper introduced the concept of Reward Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) which uses [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347).

Other methods of Aligning the model's predictions with human preferences include:
- [Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290)
- [ORPO: Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07691)
- [KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01306)

## What is a token in the context of LLMs?
Tokens are the smallest unit of text that the model can understand, they can be words, subwords, or characters.

## What are tokenizers in the context of LLMs?
Tokenizers are responsiple for converting text into tokens, they can be as simple as splitting the text by spaces, or as complex as using subword tokenization. The choice of tokenizer can have a significant impact on the model's performance, as it can affect the model's ability to understand the context of the text.

Some common tokenizers include:
- [Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1162.pdf) 
- [WordPiece](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ja//pubs/archive/37842.pdf)

## What are the different parameters that can be tuned in LLMs during inference?
Parameters include:
- Temperature
- Top P
- Max Length
- Stop Sequences
- Frequency Penalty
- Presence Penalty

Each of these parameters can be tuned to improve the performance of the model, and the quality of the generated text.

## What are the different decoding strategies for picking output tokens?
Decoding strategies are used to pick the next token in the sequence, they can range from simple greedy decoding to more complex sampling strategies. 

Some common decoding strategies include:
- Greedy Decoding
- Beam Search

Newer decoding strategies include Speculative Decoding (assisted decoding) which is a wild concept, it involves using a candidate tokens from a smaller (thus faster) model to generate a response from a bigger model very quickly.

## What are the stopping criteria for decoding in the context of LLMs?
In the decoding process, LLMs autoregressively generate text one token at a time. There are several stopping criteria that can be used to determine when to stop generating text. Some common stopping criteria include:
- Maximum Length: Stop generating text when the generated text reaches a certain length.
- End of Sentence Token: Stop generating text when the model generates an end of sentence token.
- Stop Sequences: Stop generating text when the model generates a predefined stop sequence.

## What are some elements that make up a prompt?
```
A prompt contains any of the following elements:

Instruction - a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform

Context - external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses

Input Data - the input or question that we are interested to find a response for

Output Indicator - the type or format of the output.
```

## Explain the concept of In-context Learning
In-context learning is a very intuitive and easy to understand learning paradigm in Natural Language Processing. It encompasses concepts such as few-shot learning. It can be as easy as providing a few examples of the task you want the model to perform, and the model will learn from those examples and generate responses accordingly.

## When does In-context Learning fail?
It has been shown that In-context Learning can only emerge when the models are scaled to a certain size, and when the models are trained on a diverse set of tasks. In-context learning can fail when the model is not able to perform complex reasoning tasks.

## What prompt engineering concept is known to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs?
The concept of Chain-of-Thought Prompting is known to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs. This technique involves breaking down a complex task into a series of simpler tasks, and providing the model with the intermediate outputs of each task to guide it towards the final output.

## What is a common design pattern for grounding LLM answers in facts?
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a common design pattern for grounding LLM answers in facts. This technique involves retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using it to guide the generation of text by the LLM.

## Explain the intuition and methodology behind Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is composed of two main component:
- A retriever: This component is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base given a query.
- A generator: This component is responsible for generating text based on the retrieved information.

The intuition behind RAG is that by combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models, we can create a system that is capable of generating text that is grounded in facts, thus limiting hallucination.

RAG is often the go-to technique for answering complex questions based on a knowledge base, as it allows the model to leverage external information to provide more accurate and informative answers. It is not always feasible to fine-tune a model on proprietary data, and RAG provides a way to incorporate external knowledge without the need for fine-tuning.

## Provide a high-level overview of the steps involved in implementing a full solution that utilizes RAG to answer a complex question based on a knowledge base
A full solution that utilizes RAG to answer a complex question based on a knowledge base would involve the following steps:
- Data Ingestion: documents or data streams that compromise the knowledge base are ingested into a data pipeline and processed in a way that is suitable for retrieval.
- Indexing: the processed data is indexed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval.
- Retrieval: given a query, the retriever component retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base.
- Generation: the generator component generates text based on the retrieved information.
- Post-processing: the generated text is post-processed to ensure factuality and integrity.

## Explain the concept of chunking and its importance to RAG systems
Chunking text is the process of breaking down a large piece of text into smaller, more manageable chunks. In the context of RAG systems, chunking is important because it allows the retriever component to efficiently retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base. By breaking down the query into smaller chunks, the retriever can focus on retrieving information that is relevant to each chunk, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the retrieval process.

During the training of embedding models, which are often used as retrievers, positive and negative pairs of text are used to indicate what pieces of text correspond to each other, examples include the titles, headers and subheaders on a Wikipedia page, and their corresponding paragraphs, reddit posts and their top voted comments, etc.

A user query is often embedded, and an index is queried, if the index had entire documents contained within it to be queried for top-k hits, a retreiver would not be able to return the most relevant information, as the documents to be queried would be too large to comprehend.

To summarize, we chunk text to:
- Break down large pieces of text into smaller, more manageable chunks, where we ideally wish to have each chunk contain defined pieces of information we can query.
- Embedding models often have fixed context lengths, we cannot embed an entire book.
- Intuitively, when we search for information, we know the book we want to use as reference (corresponding to an index here), we'd use chapters and subchapters (our chunks) to find the information we need.
- Embedding models compress semantic information into a lower dimensional space, as the size of the text increases, the amount of information that is lost increases, and the model's ability to retrieve relevant information decreases.

## Explain the intuition behind chunk sizes using an example
Suppose we have a book, containing 24 chapters, a total of 240 pages.
This would mean that each chapter contains 10 pages, and each page contains 3 paragraphs.
Let's suppose that each paragraph contains 5 sentences, and each sentence contains 10 words.
In total, we have: 10 * 5 * 3 * 10 = 1500 words per chapter. 
We also have 1500 * 24 = 36000 words in the entire book.
For simplicity, our tokenizer is a white space tokenizer, and each word is a token.

We know that at most, we have an embedding model capable of embedding 8192 tokens:
- If we were to embed the entire book, we would have to chunk the book into 5 chunks. Each chunk would contain 5 chapters, with 7200 tokens. This is a tremendous amount of information to embed, and the model would not be able to retrieve relevant information efficiently.
- We can embed each chapter individually, this would mean that each chapter would yeild 1500 tokens, which is well within the model's capacity to embed. But we know that chapters contain multiple topics, and we would not be able to retrieve the most relevant information.
- We can embed each page, resulting in 450 tokens per page, this is a good balance between the two extremes, as pages often contain a single topic, and we would be able to retrieve the most relevant information, however, what if the information we need is spread across multiple pages?
- We can embed each paragraph individually, this would mean that each paragraph would yeild 150 tokens, which is well within the model's capacity to embed. TParagraphs often contain a single topic, and we would be able to retrieve the most relevant information, however, what if the flow of information is not linear, and the information we need is spread across multiple paragraphs, and we need to aggregate it?
- We can embed each sentence individually, but here we risk losing the context of the paragraph, and the model would not be able to retrieve the most relevant information.

All of this is to illustrate that there is no fixed way to chunk text, and the best way to chunk text is to experiment and see what works best for your use case.

## What are the different chunking strategies used in RAG systems and how do you evaluate your chunking strategy?

## Explain the concept of a vector embedding
Vector embeddings are the mapping of textual semantics into an N-dimensional space where vectors represent text, within the vector space, similar text is represented by similar vectors.

Recommended Reading:
- [What are Vector Embeddings?](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/vector-embedding)

## What are embedding models?
Embedding models are Language Models trained for the purpose of vectorizing text, they are often BERT derivatives, and are trained on a large corpus of text to learn the semantics of the text, recent trends however also show it is possible to use much larger language models for this purpose such as Mistral or Llama.

## How do embedding models work in the context of systems with LLMs?
Embedding models are often used as retrievers, to utilize their retrieval capabilities, semantic textual similarity is used where in vectors produced by the models are measured in similarity using metrics such as dot product, cosine similarity, etc.

## Explain the intuition behind single vector dense represenations
Single vector dense represenations are often the norm in text embedding models, they're usually produced by pooling the contextualized embeddings after a forward pass from the model, pooling techniques include mean pooling, max pooling, and CLS token pooling. 

## Explain the intuition behind multi vector dense represenations
Multi vector dense represenations have shown to produce superior results to single vector dense represenations, they are produced by skipping the pooling step and using the contextualized embeddings in the form of a matrix, the query and document embeddings are then used to calculate the similarity between the two, models such as ColBERT have shown to produce superior results to single vector dense represenations. 
An operator such as MaxSim is used to calculate the similarity between the query and document embeddings.

## Explain the intuition behind sparse represenations
Sparse text represenations are the oldest form of vector space models in information retrieval, they are usually based on TF-IDF derivatives and algorithms such as BM25, and remain a baseline for text retrieval systems. Their sparsity stems from the fact that the dimension of the embeddings often corresponds to the size of the vocabulary.
